<p>James’s Original Sacred Harp featured a statistical table immediately following its title page. This “Summary Statement” lists esoteric statistics—many of them erroneous or unverifiable—such as “the total number of notes used in entire book,” the “total number of words and parts of words” in the scripture citations that accompany each song, and more basic information such as the total number of songs and pages. The original summary statement aligned with the modernizing New South’s emphasis on industrial accounting and factbooks. The digital critical edition, motivated by the transformative value of digital methods and publishing platforms, features its own “Summary Statement,” a collection of data visualizations drawn from Original Sacred Harp. These interactive graphics include a rendering of the sources for James’s historical notes, a map displaying the locations and biographies of the book’s contributors and editors in relation to the geography of contributors to previous and subsequent editions, as well as updated figures for some of James’s original statistics.</p>
