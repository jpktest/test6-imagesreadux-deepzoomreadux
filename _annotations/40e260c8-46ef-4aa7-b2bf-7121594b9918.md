"George Byron Daniell (21 February 1860-24 September 1933), son of William Robert Daniell and Henrietta Virginia Jennings, was born in Tallapoosa, Georgia, but spent most of his life in Atlanta, where was a singing teacher and a laborer. On 11 October 1881 Daniell married Olive Adelaide "Addie" Hamby.  Daniell served as clerk of a Primitive Baptist church, and J. S. James reports that "seven of his grandfather's brothers were Primitive Baptist ministers."  He died in Atlanta and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery."
