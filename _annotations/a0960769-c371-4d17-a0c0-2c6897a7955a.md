Dr. S. W. Everett was born around 1851. He served as a committee member for the 1909 *Union Harp* and a sub-committee member for the 1911 *Original Sacred Harp*. With T. B. Newton, he rearranged RESTORATION, which is included in both the *Union Harp* (184b) and *Original Sacred Harp* (312b). In 1910, he lived in Stansells, Newton County, Georgia and worked as a farmer and medical doctor. By 1920, he was only working as a physician and was living in the town of Almon, Newton County, Georgia. J. S. James identified Everett in *Union Harp* as “a strict member of the Primitive Baptist church.”
