"Jackson C. Brown (March 1849-after 1913), was a son of S. M. Brown and Elizabeth Chandler, born in Haralson County, Georgia... He was a Baptist deacon.  A member of the United Sacred Harp Musical Association, he was on a committee appointed by that body to compile the *Union Harp and Histroy of Song* (1909), to which he contributed THE BLIND GIRL in collaboration with his brother John M. Brown."
