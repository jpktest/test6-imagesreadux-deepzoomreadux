In the 1909 *Union Harp*, the hymn text reads "Praise God, from whom all blessings flow; Praise Him, all creatures here below; Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host; Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!".  This hymn is correctly attributed to Bishop Ken in that edition.  The attribution of this hymn text to Bishop Ken in this edition is erroneous.
