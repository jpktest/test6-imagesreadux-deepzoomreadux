"Joseph Stephen James (20 March 1849–20 January 1931), born in Campbell County, Georgia (now Douglas County), was one of many children born to singing teacher Stephen James (1821–72) and Martha Shipley ... Largely self-educated, he attended only a log schoolhouse near his home, yet he was admitted to the bar in 1875 and became an attorney, politician, and land speculator in his hometown of Douglasville.  He served as a surveyor for the Georgia Pacific Railroad, as a state representative, as the first mayor of Douglasville, as a U. S. district attorney, and as editor of a local newspaper, *The New South*.  He was a Methodist and a Mason."
