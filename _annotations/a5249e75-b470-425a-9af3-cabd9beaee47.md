"Absalom Ogletree (25 October 1817â€“2 August 1910), was born in Wilkes County, Georgia, the son of Absalom Ogletree and Elenor Grey ... Ogletree was a farmer in the Birdie community, a singing teacher, a Methodist, and a Mason.  A close friend and pupil of B. F. White and J. R. Turner, Ogletree was Major White's right-hand man in all the revisions of the *Sacred Harp*, serving on revision committees in 1850, 1859, and 1869, as well as the committees for *Union Harp and History of Songs* (1909) and *Original Sacred Harp* (1911)."
