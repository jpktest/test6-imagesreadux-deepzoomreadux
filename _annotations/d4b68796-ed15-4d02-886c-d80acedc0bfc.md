Charles J. (C. J.) Griggs was born in Cobb County, Georgia, January 1856 and died June 21, 1941, in Fulton County, Georgia. He is buried at Westview Cemetery in Atlanta. According to Joseph Stephen James, Griggs was a member of the Methodist Church. Griggs lived in Atlanta at least from 1900 through 1940. In 1900 he was working as a railroad engineer; by 1910 he was employed as a railroad conductor, moving on by 1920 to employment for the “Steam Railroad” as a “Switch Tender.” By 1930, he was retired. He lived at 58 Irwin Street in Atlanta’s Fourth Ward with his wife Vassie (Vassay) T. Griggs and his daughter May (Mae) H. Griggs, even after she married Comer (Elmer) L. Parsons. Griggs contributed two additional verses to THE HAPPY SAILOR for the *Original Sacred Harp*. He served on the *Original Sacred Harp* and *Union Harp* revision committees. Griggs wrote a short essay on *The Sacred Harp*, titled “A Sketch or Brief History of the Sacred Harp Song Book,” in 1936.
