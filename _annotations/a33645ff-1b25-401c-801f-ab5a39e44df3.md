Marion David (M. D.) Farris was born August 10, 1862, in Georgia and died April 8, 1924, in Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia. By age 18, his family was living in Panthersville, DeKalb County, Georgia. Sue Ellen Fealko identifies Farris as a carpenter, but, in the 1920 Census, his job title is described as “Night Superintendent Juvenile Court.” He was a committee member for the 1909 *Union Harp* and a sub-committee member for the 1911 *Original Sacred Harp*. Farris contributed the tune JAMES to the *Union Harp* (208).
