S. M. Denson arranged the alto line for “Mear” by stitching together components of alto lines by William Walker in *The Christian Harmony* (59) and by B. P. Poyner in W. M. Cooper’s *Sacred Harp* (49b). Every note in Denson’s alto part matches the corresponding note in one or more of these two sources. As illustrated in the diagram below, Denson primarily drew on Walker’s alto for the first three quarters of the song, while selecting Poyner’s alto for much of the song’s final phrase. Denson’s selections from the two sources indicates a slight preference for the lower of the two options and a preference for melodic movement over repeated notes of the same scale degree.
