Green Berry (G. B.) Holder was born December 22, 1843, in Lawrenceville, Gwinnett County, Georgia and died June 18, 1914 in Rome, Floyd County, Georgia. He served as a committee member for both the *Union Harp* and the *Original Sacred Harp*. He worked as a “traveling salesman” in 1900 and as a “trader” in 1910. He and his wife Ansibelle [sic] (Annie) had eleven children and are both buried in the Myrtle Hill Cemetery, Rome, Floyd County, Georgia. Holder was one of four leaders of the United Sacred Harp Musical Association who followed James Landrum White in seceding from the convention on September 8, 1911, in protest of the adoption of J. S. James’s *Original Sacred Harp* as the official tunebook of the convention.
