"Thomas Jackson Denson (20 January 1863-14 September 1935), was born in Randolph County, Alabama, the youngest of four sons of Levi Phillips Denson and Julia Ann Jonesâ€”he was named for Confederate general Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson... Raised in the Methodist church, he later joined the Missionary Baptist faith of the Burdette family; he was also a member of the Masons and the Odd Fellows."
