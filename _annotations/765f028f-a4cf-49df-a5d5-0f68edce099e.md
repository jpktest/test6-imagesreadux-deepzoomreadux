Thomas Byrd (T. B.) Newton, Sr. was born November 15, 1836, and died August 10, 1925. He is buried in the Boiling Springs Primitive Baptist Church Cemetery, Alpharetta, Fulton County, Georgia. A singing school teacher, Newton was a committee member for both the *Union Harp* and *Original Sacred Harp*. Along with S. W. Everett, Newton rearranged the tune RESTORATION, which appears in the *Union Harp* (184b) and *Original Sacred Harp* (312b). Newton rearranged John G. McCurry’s RIVER OF JORDAN (493) with S. M. Denson and J. S. James. Newton also contributed the biographical sketch of J. H. Moss (Newton’s own singing school instructor) to accompany Moss’s tune SINGING SCHOOL in *Original Sacred Harp* (263). 

Newton served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, beginning as a private and becoming a First Sergeant by the end of his service. He was in the 38th Regiment, Georgia Infantry, Company B. In 1880, Newton lived with his wife Frances (Fannie) and seven of their children in Double Branch, Milton County, Georgia, where he worked as a “Laborer.” By 1910, his wife had passed away, and he was living in Little River, Milton County, as a boarder with Nancy J. Broadwell and her grandson. By 1920, he had moved in with his son, Thomas B. Newton, Jr., and Newton, Jr.’s family, back in Double Branch.
