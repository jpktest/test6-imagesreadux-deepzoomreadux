"Millard Fillmore McWhorter, Sr. (21 November 1858-16 March 1940), the son of Moses McWhorter (1824-58) and Mary A. McElroy (1833-1906), was a native of Georgia but came as a child to Cleburne County, Alabama; there he studied music with S. M. and T. J. Denson.  He became a farmer, businessman, county commissioner, and sherrif, and was a singing teacher for fifty years.  He was a member of Mars Hill Primitive Baptist Church.  He married (I)  Martha Jane Hayes (1861-1931) in 1877 and (2) Bertha B. Mills in 1932.  He contributed four songs to the *Union Harp* (1909) and at least two to J. L. White's "fifth edition" of *The Sacred Harp* (1909); he had additional unpublished music, but this was lost after his death.  He was buried at Mt. Paran cemetery, Cleburne County."
