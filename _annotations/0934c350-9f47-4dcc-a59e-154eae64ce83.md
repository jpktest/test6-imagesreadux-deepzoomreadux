Jake C. (J. C.) Moore was born September 12, 1851, in Brooks, Georgia. He was a committee member for both the *Union Harp* and *Original Sacred Harp*. In 1900, he worked as a State Warder and lived in Rome, Floyd County, Georgia, with his wife and two daughters. He died January 11, 1912, and is buried in the New Smyrna Cemetery, Smyrna, Cobb County, Georgia. Moore is named as one one of the five leaders of the secession from the United Sacred Harp Musical Association in 1911, led by James Landrum White, over a protest of the adoption of the J. S. Jamesâ€™s *Original Sacred Harp* as the official tunebook of the convention.
