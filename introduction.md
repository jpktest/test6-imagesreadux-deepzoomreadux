The Original Sacred Harp, now over a century old, profoundly impacted the history of The Sacred Harp, a shape-note tunebook in print (and in active use) since 1844. Edited by a committee headed by Joseph Stephen James (1849–1931, hereafter J. S. James), and published in Atlanta in 1911, Original Sacred Harp competed against several rival early-twentieth-century editions of The Sacred Harp and won the widest adoption. Often called the “James book,” Original Sacred Harp is the direct progenitor of The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition, the edition of the tunebook that enjoys the most widespread contemporary use by singers from Massachusetts to California, Atlanta to Sydney.</p>
 
<p align="left"> Sacred Harp singing is an a cappella group harmony style based around singing from The Sacred Harp. This singing practice revolves around weekend-long, annual singing conventions at which participants sit in an inward-facing hollow square (with one vocal part on each side), and a succession of leaders stand in the middle, directing the assembled “class” in selections from the tunebook. By 1900, singing conventions featuring The Sacred Harp extended from Georgia to Texas, and included people from a wide range of social strata and occupations. White and black men and women attended Sacred Harp singings, though most singings were racially segregated, and the tunebook editors and contributors were exclusively white. After the turn of the twentieth century, leading singers edited the first revisions of The Sacred Harp following the death of its senior compiler, Benjamin Franklin White (1800–79).</p>
  
<p align="left"> Several features of one of these editions, Original Sacred Harp, make it exceptional. Each song in Original Sacred Harp includes a historical note written by James. These annotations comprised the most ambitious and accessible record of the history of the songs and hymns in The Sacred Harp and their writers until David Warren Steel’s 2010 reference work, The Makers of the Sacred Harp. Although of variable accuracy, the annotations in Original Sacred Harp are a valuable source of information—and occasionally humor. They also reveal that The Sacred Harp had become the subject of historical study by the early twentieth century. More than a tunebook, the annotations in Original Sacred Harp show how The Sacred Harp had become the centerpiece of a tradition of singing.</p>

  James’s historical notes, Original Sacred Harp’s introduction, and the design of the book also hint at how Sacred Harp singing corresponded with the political and social worlds of the tunebook’s editors. The much-heralded musical conservatism of Original Sacred Harp was the result of conflict with editors of rival Sacred Harp editions and a conception of Sacred Harp singing that tied the tunebook to idealized memories of the antebellum South and a grand narrative of English and American Protestant thought. Less widely acknowledged, the “James book” also embraced all manner of “material modern improvement,” thanks to its editors’ desire to make Sacred Harp singing relevant to urban audiences in the industrial, modernizing “New South.”</p>

<h3>
Revising The Sacred Harp in the Twentieth Century</h3>

<p align="left">  
  The “James book” was the last and most unlikely of the revisions of The Sacred Harp published in the early twentieth century. Its distinct character reflects shortcomings that James perceived in its predecessors; decisions made by the editors of earlier twentieth-century revisions, and the reception their books earned, help explain the form and contents of Original Sacred Harp.</p>

  The 1844 Sacred Harp was co-edited by West Georgians Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha James King (1821–44). The tunebook uses the four-shape system of shape-notes pioneered in William Little and William Smith’s 1801 Easy Instructor, which pairs triangle, circle, square, and diamond shapes with the tones of the scale and the syllables “faw,” “sol,” “law,” and “me.” White supervised enlargements of the tunebook in 1850 and 1859 and a revision with a third appendix in 1870. White was at work on a fifth edition of The Sacred Harp when he died in 1879. Work on the new edition was suspended, throwing its future into question.</p>

  Two of White’s sons published The New Sacred Harp in 1884. Their tunebook adopted a newer seven-shape shape-note system, incorporated many “Sabbath School” songs and those written in an early gospel style, and featured
