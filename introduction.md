*The Original Sacred Harp*, now over a century old, profoundly impacted the history of *The Sacred Harp*, a shape-note tunebook in print (and in active use) since 1844. Edited by a committee headed by Joseph Stephen James (1849–1931, hereafter J. S. James), and published in Atlanta in 1911, *Original Sacred Harp* competed against several rival early-twentieth-century editions of The Sacred Harp and won the widest adoption. Often called the “James book,” Original Sacred Harp is the direct progenitor of *The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition*, the edition of the tunebook that enjoys the most widespread contemporary use by singers from Massachusetts to California, Atlanta to Sydney.
 

Sacred Harp singing is an a cappella group harmony style based around singing from *The Sacred Harp*. This singing practice revolves around weekend-long, annual singing conventions at which participants sit in an inward-facing hollow square (with one vocal part on each side), and a succession of leaders stand in the middle, directing the assembled “class” in selections from the tunebook. By 1900, singing conventions featuring *The Sacred Harp* extended from Georgia to Texas, and included people from a wide range of social strata and occupations. White and black men and women attended Sacred Harp singings, though most singings were racially segregated, and the tunebook editors and contributors were exclusively white. After the turn of the twentieth century, leading singers edited the first revisions of The Sacred Harp following the death of its senior compiler, Benjamin Franklin White (1800–79).
